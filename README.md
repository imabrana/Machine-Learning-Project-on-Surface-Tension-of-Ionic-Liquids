# Machine-Learning-Project-on-Surface-Tension-of-Ionic-Liquids
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict surface tension of ionic liquids using temperature and molecular descriptors from the Surface_tension_ILs_RDkit.xlsx dataset for the MLCE 2025 Course Project. Implemented polynomial regression, Gaussian Process Regression, KNN regression, and optimized Artificial Neural Networks to model surface tension, evaluated performance with MSE and RÂ² metrics, and visualized results through plots. Conducted data splitting, feature selection using correlation-based and RFE methods, and hyperparameter tuning. Used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to deliver accurate predictions and insights for chemical engineering applications.
